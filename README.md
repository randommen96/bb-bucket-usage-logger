# bb-bucket-usage-logger
Simple python tool to login to backblaze, scrape all the bucket sizes and save them into a CSV file for later usage.

Usage:
Place the tool somewhere on your disk, I recommend a linux distro and use crontab to kick it off once in a while.
Make sure to fill in the .env file correctly.
